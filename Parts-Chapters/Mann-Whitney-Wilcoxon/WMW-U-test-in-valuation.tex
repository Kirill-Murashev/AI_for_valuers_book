\begin{abstract}
	In~their practice appraisers often face the~need to~take into account differences in~quantitative and~qualitative characteristics of~objects. In~particular, one of~the~standard tasks is~to~determine the~attributes that influence the~cost (so-called "pricing factors") and~to~separate them from the~attributes that do~not or~cannot be~determined.
	
	Subjective selection of~attributes taken into account in~determining the~value is~widespread in~valuation practice. In~this case, specific quantitative indicators of~the~impact of~these attributes on~the~cost are~often taken from the~so-called "reference books". While not~denying the~speed and~low cost of~this approach, it~should~be recognized that only data directly observed in~the open markets is~a~reliable basis for~a~value judgment. The priority of~such data over other data, in~particular those obtained by~expert survey, is~enshrined, among others, in~\href{https://www.rics.org/uk/upholding-professional-standards/sector-standards/valuation/red-book/red-book-global/}{RICS Valuation --- Global Standards 2022}~\cite{RVGS-2022}, \href{https://www.rics.org/uk/upholding-professional-standards/sector-standards/valuation/red-book/international-valuation-standards/}{International Valuation Standards 2022}~\cite{IVS-2022}, as~well as~in~\href{http://eifrs.ifrs.org/eifrs/bnstandards/en/IFRS13.pdf}{IFRS~13 "Fair Value Measurement"}~\cite{IFRS-13}. Therefore, we~can say that mathematical methods for~analyzing data from the open market are the~most reliable means of~interpreting market information used in~market research and~predicting the~value of~individual objects.
	
	The aim of~this work is~to~justify the~necessity and~possibility of~using a~rigorous mathematical Wilcoxon--Mann--Whitney test, which allows us~to~answer the~question about the~necessity of~taking into account the~binary attribute as~a~price-generating factor. Instead of~the~judgmental approach, which is~most commonly used by~appraisers in~selecting the~attributes to~be considered in~appraisal, this paper proposes the~idea of~prioritizing the~measuring approach based on~the~results of~a~mathematical test that allows to~draw a~conclusion about the~importance or~otherwise of~the~binary attribute influence on~the~value. It~should~be noted that despite the~fact that the~statistical test under consideration belongs to~frequentist statistics, it, through its~connection to~ROC analysis and~AUC, is~related to~modern machine learning methods, which will~be discussed later in~the~text of~this material. The~presence of~this relationship and~elements of~Bayesian statistics seems particularly interesting and~promising from the~point of~view of~introducing machine learning and~data analysis methods into the~everyday practice of~appraisers.
	
	Users should have some general math background and~basic Python and~R programming skills to~understand and~practice all of~the material in~the~text, but~lack of~that knowledge and~skill is~not~a~barrier to~learning most of~the~material and~implementing the~test in~the~spreadsheet that comes with it.
	
	The material consists of~four blocks:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item a~description of~the~Wilcoxon--Mann--Whitney test (hereafter "U-test"), its probabilistic meaning, and~its relationship to~other mathematical methods;
		\item a~practical implementation of~the~U-test in~a~spreadsheet on~an~example of~test random data;
		\item practical implementation of~the~U-test on~the~real data of~the~residential real estate market of~St.~Petersburg agglomeration by~means of~Python programming language, the~purpose of~the~analysis was~to~check the~significance of~the~difference in~the~unit price between the~objects located in~the~urban and~suburban parts of~the~agglomeration;
		\item practical implementation of~the~U-test on~real data of~residential real estate market of~Almaty by~means of~R programming language, the~purpose of~the~analysis was~to~check the~significance of~difference in~unit price between the~objects sold without demountable improvements and~the~objects sold with them.
	\end{itemize}
	The~current version of~this material, its source code, Python and~R scripts, and~the~spreadsheet are~in~the~repository on~the GitHub portal and~are~available at~the~\href{https://github.com/Kirill-Murashev/AI_for_valuers_book/tree/main/Parts-Chapters/Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon}{permanent link}~\cite{Murashev:u-test}.
